# Python Mini Project - Extractive Text Summarizer with PyQt5 GUI

This Python mini project utilizes the **PyQt5** library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for an **extractive text summarizer**. The project is based on the concept of extractive summary generation, which condenses the content of a text while preserving its key information.

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for summarizing text by extracting the most important sentences from a given input. The GUI allows users to input the text they want to summarize and specify the desired number of sentences in the summary.

## Implementation Details

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **PyQt5**: The GUI framework used to create the graphical interface.
- **NLTK**: The Natural Language Toolkit library used for text processing and summarization.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these general steps:

1. **User Interface**: The PyQt5 library is used to create an interactive GUI that allows users to input the text they want to summarize and specify the desired number of sentences in the summary.

2. **Text Processing**: The input text is processed using NLTK to remove stopwords, tokenize the text into sentences, and perform any necessary preprocessing steps.

3. **Extractive Summarization**: The project employs an extractive summarization technique to identify the most important sentences from the input text. This can involve techniques such as sentence scoring based on relevance or importance.

4. **Summary Generation**: The selected sentences are combined to generate a concise summary of the input text.

5. **Displaying the Summary**: The generated summary is displayed in the GUI for the user to view and utilize.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies, including Python, PyQt5, and NLTK.
2. Run the Python script that contains the GUI implementation.
3. Input the text you want to summarize and specify the desired number of sentences in the summary.
4. Click the "Summarize" button to generate the summary.
5. The generated summary will be displayed in the GUI for your reference.
